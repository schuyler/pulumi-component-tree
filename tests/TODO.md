# Additional Test Cases Needed

The following test cases would provide better coverage of real-world scenarios and edge cases:

## 1. Circular Dependency Detection
Test how the system handles attempts to create circular dependencies between components.

**Importance**: Circular dependencies could accidentally occur in complex infrastructure and should fail with clear errors.

**Scenario**:
- Component A adds Component B
- Component B attempts to add Component A back as a child
- Should detect and prevent the circular dependency

## 2. Cross-Tree References
Test components that need to reference resources from other parts of the component tree.

**Importance**: Common in real infrastructure where resources need to reference others not directly related.

**Scenario**:
- Create two separate branches in the component tree
- Have a component in one branch reference a resource from the other branch
- Verify proper dependency management and reference resolution

## 3. Error Propagation in Tree Construction
Test how errors during component construction affect the rest of the tree.

**Importance**: Understanding failure modes is critical for infrastructure reliability.

**Scenario**:
- Create a tree with multiple levels of components
- Force an error in one child's _construct()
- Verify:
  - Error handling in parent components
  - State of sibling components
  - Cleanup of partially constructed resources

## 4. Resource Options Inheritance Chain
Test complex scenarios of ResourceOptions inheritance through multiple levels.

**Importance**: Affects how infrastructure can be modified/protected.

**Scenario**:
- Grandparent sets protect=true
- Parent attempts to override with protect=false
- Child sets additional options
- Verify final effective options at each level

## 5. Component Reuse
Test behavior when attempting to reuse component instances.

**Importance**: Should prevent confusing ownership scenarios.

**Scenario**:
- Create a component instance
- Attempt to add it to multiple parent components
- Verify it fails with clear error message about single-parent requirement

## 6. Dynamic Child Addition
Test adding children based on parent properties.

**Importance**: Common pattern for flexible infrastructure templates.

**Scenario**:
- Create parent with property controlling number of children
- Dynamically add children based on that property
- Verify proper construction order and dependency management

## 7. Extend Inheritance Chain
Test property inheritance through multiple levels using extend().

**Importance**: Understanding property precedence in complex hierarchies.

**Scenario**:
- Grandparent extends properties for ComponentType
- Parent also extends properties for same ComponentType
- Create child of ComponentType
- Verify proper merging of extended properties from all levels

Each test case should include both happy path and error scenarios to ensure robust handling of all situations.
